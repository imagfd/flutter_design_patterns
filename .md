------------FlyWeight DP--------------------
/*
topic :  draw many cars on a huge map on different positions.

Problem :  we create too many objects at each position while drawing. That  might consume a large piece of memory and can slow down the application or even cause out of memory problems.

Solution : to save memory , we recommend using FlyWeight design pattern. that check if the object has been created you're drawing with at many positions.

topic : change app theme

problem  :
the home page  can be in dark mode and in light mode, so we will have two home pages !
the contact page can be in dark mode and in light mode, so we will have two contact pages !
how do both types of classes can be altered structurally without affecting each other.

solution :
We have a IMode interface which is acting as a bridge implementer
and concrete classes DarkMode, DarkMode implementing the IMode interface.
A WebPage is a abstract class, it will  use an object of IMode
